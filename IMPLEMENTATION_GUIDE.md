# AI Security Controls — Implementation Guide

This guide points you to resources for implementing AI security controls. We don't provide code—the APIs change frequently and untested code causes more problems than it solves.

## The Pattern

![AI Security Control Pattern](images/control-pattern.svg)

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Input Guardrails** | Block malicious inputs before they reach the LLM |
| **Output Guardrails** | Validate and sanitize responses before delivery |
| **Judge Queue** | Async LLM evaluation of sampled interactions |
| **Human Review** | Final decision on edge cases and flagged content |

## What to Build

1. **Input validation**: Use your cloud provider's managed guardrails, or adapt patterns from NeMo/Guardrails AI.

2. **Output validation**: PII detection, forbidden content, structured output validation. See Guardrails AI for examples.

3. **Sampling and evaluation**: Not every interaction needs review. Sample 5-10% plus all flagged items.

4. **Human review queue**: Priority-based queue with SLA tracking. Standard engineering—use your existing tooling.

5. **Logging and metrics**: Log all interactions (inputs, outputs, blocks, latency). Essential for debugging and compliance.

## Multi-Agent Systems

The pattern above applies to single-model deployments. For systems where **multiple agents communicate, delegate, and act autonomously**, the [MASO Framework](maso/) extends these controls with additional requirements.

| MASO Component | What It Adds | Implementation Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Inter-agent message bus security | Signed messages, source tagging, injection detection between agents | [Integration Guide](maso/integration/integration-guide.md) |
| Non-Human Identity per agent | Unique credentials, scoped permissions, no transitive authority | [Identity & Access Controls](maso/controls/identity-and-access.md) |
| LLM-as-Judge for agent outputs | Independent evaluation before cross-agent actions | [Execution Control](maso/controls/execution-control.md) |
| Epistemic integrity | Hallucination chain detection, provenance tagging, uncertainty preservation | [Prompt, Goal & Epistemic Integrity](maso/controls/prompt-goal-and-epistemic-integrity.md) |
| Kill switch architecture | Independent observability agent with system-wide emergency stop | [Observability Controls](maso/controls/observability.md) |

**Framework-specific patterns** for LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and AWS Bedrock Agents are in the [Integration Guide](maso/integration/integration-guide.md).

## Recommendations

- **Start with managed services** (Bedrock Guardrails, Azure Content Filtering) before building custom.
- **Use existing libraries** rather than writing regex patterns from scratch.
- **Test against real attacks**—see OWASP LLM Top 10 for attack categories.
- **Plan for false positives**—overly aggressive filters frustrate users.
- **Keep humans in the loop**—automated systems miss edge cases.
