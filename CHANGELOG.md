# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Cost model with production data
- Platform-specific implementation guides (detailed)
- Case studies from production deployments

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **Renamed: AI Security Blueprint → Enterprise AI Security Framework**
  - Better reflects the content scope (governance, compliance, org structure)
  - "Blueprint" implied buildable artifacts; "Framework" is accurate
  
### Added
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** — New practical guide with working code
  - Input guardrails (regex + Bedrock + NeMo examples)
  - Output guardrails (PII, forbidden phrases, structured validation)
  - LLM-as-Judge (prompts, sampling strategies, async processing)
  - Human-in-the-loop queue (Redis implementation, FastAPI endpoints)
  - Telemetry and logging (structured logs, Prometheus metrics)
  - Complete request flow example
  - Test suite templates (unit tests, red team inputs)
  - ~1,500 lines of copy-paste-ready Python

### Rationale
Reality check revealed the framework was thought leadership, not a buildable blueprint. Now there are two clear paths:
- **Implementors**: Start with IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (code)
- **Architects/Governance**: Use the full Framework (strategy)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- **Major restructure: Core + Extensions model**
- New `/core/` folder with 5 essential documents:
  - README.md — Overview and quick start
  - risk-tiers.md — Classification and control selection
  - controls.md — Guardrails, Judge, HITL combined
  - agentic.md — Agent-specific controls
  - checklist.md — Implementation tracking
- New `/extensions/` folder for reference material:
  - regulatory/ — ISO 42001, EU AI Act, banking
  - technical/ — Bypass prevention, infrastructure, metrics
  - templates/ — Playbooks, assessments
  - examples/ — Worked examples
- Root README now serves as navigation hub
- Previous detailed documents preserved in extensions

### Rationale
Framework had grown to 48 files. Core + Extensions model provides clear "start here" path (5 docs) while preserving depth for those who need it.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Bypass Prevention document — comprehensive guide to preventing and detecting control circumvention across 5 bypass categories (guardrails, intent, agentic, architectural, process)
- Technical Controls document — network, firewall, WAF, AI gateway, DLP, proxy, endpoint, cloud, and IAM controls for infrastructure-level enforcement
- 14 new SVG diagrams:
  - bypass-taxonomy.svg — 5 bypass categories visual
  - defence-in-depth.svg — 8-layer control stack
  - technical-controls-architecture.svg — infrastructure overview
  - ai-gateway-architecture.svg — gateway internals
  - network-zones.svg — network segmentation
  - agent-sandbox.svg — infrastructure constraints
  - action-validator-flow.svg — action validation pipeline
  - tool-output-sanitiser.svg — tool output handling
  - canary-testing.svg — control verification programme
  - dlp-inspection-points.svg — 4 DLP layers
  - casb-ai-classification.svg — sanctioned/tolerated/blocked apps
  - bypass-learning-loop.svg — continuous improvement cycle
  - infra-vs-instruction.svg — enforcement comparison
  - multi-layer-input-validation.svg — input processing pipeline

### Changed
- Updated bypass-prevention.md and technical-controls.md to reference SVG diagrams instead of ASCII art
- Clarified lifecycle scope in README — framework is operationally focused (deployment → operation → incident response), not full AI/ML lifecycle

---

- Standard repo files: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, GOVERNANCE.md, LICENSE (MIT), SECURITY.md

### Changed
- Updated README with Templates section and new document links
- Moved "Threats" section to "Threats and Risks" with expanded content

---
