## Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Clear and direct** — Avoid jargon where possible
- **Practical** — Focus on what practitioners need
- **Honest** — Distinguish between proven and theoretical
- **Consistent** — Match the tone of existing content

### Markdown Conventions

```markdown
# Document Title (H1 - one per document)

## Major Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

**Bold** for emphasis on key terms
*Italic* for introducing new concepts
`Code` for technical terms, control IDs, file names

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data | Data |

- Bullet lists for unordered items
1. Numbered lists for sequences

> Blockquotes for important callouts
```

### Control Naming

- General AI controls: `AI.x.x` (e.g., AI.7.1 Input Guardrails)
- Agentic controls: `AG.x.x` (e.g., AG.2.2 Circuit Breakers)
- Always include the control name after the ID

### File Naming

- Lowercase with hyphens: `my-document-name.md`
- Numbered prefixes for ordered content: `01-introduction.md`
- SVG for diagrams: `diagram-name.svg`
