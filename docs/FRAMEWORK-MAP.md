## Two Architectures, One Framework

This framework has two halves. The **Foundation** covers single-model AI deployments. **MASO** extends it to multi-agent orchestration. Both share the same three-layer pattern (Guardrails → Judge → Human Oversight) and PACE resilience methodology — MASO adds the controls needed when agents communicate, delegate, and act across trust boundaries.

[![Single-Agent Architecture](images/single-agent-architecture.svg)](images/single-agent-architecture.svg)

**Foundation** — Three-layer runtime security for single-model AI. Risk classification, 80 infrastructure controls, PACE resilience, fast lane for low-risk deployments. **→ [Start here](foundations/)**

[![MASO Tube Map](images/maso-tube-map.svg)](images/maso-tube-map.svg)

**MASO** — Six control domains, 93 controls, three implementation tiers, dual OWASP coverage. For systems where multiple agents collaborate autonomously. **→ [Start here](maso/)**

## Reading Paths

### "I need to explain this to leadership"

Start with strategy, then the business case for controls.

1. [AI Strategy](strategy/) — business alignment, data reality, human factors, progression
2. [The First Control: Choosing the Right Tool](insights/the-first-control.md) — frames the design-thinking question
3. [Why Your AI Guardrails Aren't Enough](insights/why-guardrails-arent-enough.md) — the case for the Judge layer
4. [Humans Remain Accountable](insights/humans-remain-accountable.md) — accountability model
5. [When Agents Talk to Agents](insights/when-agents-talk-to-agents.md) — the multi-agent problem statement

Then the two operational gap articles most boards haven't heard about: [The Supply Chain Problem](insights/the-supply-chain-problem.md) and [RAG Is Your Biggest Attack Surface](insights/rag-is-your-biggest-attack-surface.md).

For multi-agent specifically, the [MASO worked examples](maso/examples/worked-examples.md) (financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure) translate technical controls into business scenarios.

### "I'm deploying a single-model AI system"

Follow the foundation path:

1. [Quick Start](QUICK_START.md) — zero to working controls in 30 minutes
2. [Risk Tiers](core/risk-tiers.md) — classify your system
3. [Controls](core/controls.md) — implement the three-layer pattern
4. [PACE Resilience](PACE-RESILIENCE.md) — define fail postures and fallback paths
5. [Checklist](core/checklist.md) — track progress

If your system qualifies for the [Fast Lane](FAST-LANE.md) (internal, read-only, no regulated data, human-reviewed), start there instead — minimal controls, self-certification, deploy in days.

If your system is agentic (single agent with tool access), add [Agentic Controls](core/agentic.md) after step 3.

### "I'm building a multi-agent system"

Start with the foundation path above — the single-agent controls are the baseline. Then layer on MASO:

1. [MASO Overview](maso/) — architecture, control domains, OWASP mapping
2. [Tier 1 — Supervised](maso/implementation/tier-1-supervised.md) — start here (human approves all writes)
3. [Integration Guide](maso/integration/integration-guide.md) — LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, AWS Bedrock patterns
4. [Red Team Playbook](maso/red-team/red-team-playbook.md) — 13 adversarial test scenarios

Graduate to [Tier 2](maso/implementation/tier-2-managed.md) and [Tier 3](maso/implementation/tier-3-autonomous.md) as your controls mature. The tier guides include graduation criteria — don't skip tiers.

### "I'm an architect designing the pipeline"

Start with the challenges that affect your architecture:

| If you're deploying... | Read this first |
|---|---|
| Multimodal models | [Multimodal Breaks Guardrails](insights/multimodal-breaks-guardrails.md) |
| Reasoning models | [When AI Thinks Before It Answers](insights/when-ai-thinks.md) |
| Single agents with tools | [Agentic Controls](core/agentic.md) |
| Multi-agent orchestration | [MASO Overview](maso/) → [Integration Guide](maso/integration/integration-guide.md) |
| Streaming responses | [Can't Validate What Hasn't Finished](insights/you-cant-validate-unfinished.md) |
| RAG pipelines | [RAG Is Your Biggest Attack Surface](insights/rag-is-your-biggest-attack-surface.md) |

Then the data-layer controls: [RAG Security](extensions/technical/rag-security.md), [Supply Chain](extensions/technical/supply-chain.md), [Memory & Context](core/memory-and-context.md).

For infrastructure enforcement: [Infrastructure Controls](infrastructure/) — 80 controls across 11 domains with AWS, Azure, and Databricks patterns.

### "I run a SOC and need to operationalise AI monitoring"

1. [Behavioral Anomaly Detection](insights/behavioral-anomaly-detection.md) — what you're looking for and why traditional detection doesn't apply
2. [SOC Integration](extensions/technical/soc-integration.md) — alert taxonomy, SIEM rules, triage
3. [Anomaly Detection Ops](extensions/technical/anomaly-detection-ops.md) — baselining and detection engineering
4. [Cost & Latency](extensions/technical/cost-and-latency.md) — budget the evaluation layer

For multi-agent monitoring, the [MASO Observability domain](maso/controls/observability.md) covers decision chain audit, anomaly scoring, drift detection, and independent kill switch architecture. The [Incident Tracker](maso/threat-intelligence/incident-tracker.md) maps 10 real-world AI security incidents to specific controls.

### "I need regulatory alignment"

| Standard | Single-Agent Mapping | Multi-Agent Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) | [OWASP mapping](infrastructure/mappings/owasp-llm-top10.md) | [MASO OWASP coverage](maso/) |
| OWASP Agentic Top 10 (2026) | — | [MASO OWASP coverage](maso/) |
| ISO 42001 | [ISO 42001 mapping](infrastructure/mappings/iso42001-annex-a.md) | [MASO regulatory alignment](maso/) |
| NIST AI RMF | [NIST mapping](infrastructure/mappings/nist-ai-rmf.md) | [MASO regulatory alignment](maso/) |
| EU AI Act | [EU AI Act mapping](extensions/regulatory/) | [MASO regulatory alignment](maso/) |
| NIST SP 800-218A | [SP 800-218A mapping](infrastructure/mappings/nist-sp800-218a.md) | — |
| DORA | — | [MASO regulatory alignment](maso/) |

### "I need to test and red team AI controls"

**Single-agent:** [Threat Model Template](extensions/templates/threat-model-template.md) → [Testing Guidance](extensions/templates/testing-guidance.md). Design adversarial tests targeting guardrails, Judge, and human oversight. Results feed back into control tuning — testing is continuous, not a pre-deployment gate.

**Multi-agent:** [Red Team Playbook](maso/red-team/red-team-playbook.md) — 13 structured scenarios across three tiers, from basic inter-agent prompt injection (RT-01) to PACE transition under active attack (RT-12). Includes success criteria, detection latency targets, and escalation guidance.
