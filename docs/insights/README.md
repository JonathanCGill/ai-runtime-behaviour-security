# Insights

The *why* before the *how*. Each article identifies a specific problem that the [core controls](../core) and [extensions](../extensions) then solve.

## Start Here

These establish the foundational argument: AI systems are non-deterministic, so you can't fully test them before deployment. Runtime behavioral monitoring is the answer.
