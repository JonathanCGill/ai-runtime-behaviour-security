# Worked Example: Customer Service AI at Meridian Bank

> A complete walkthrough of implementing AI security controls for a real-world use case.

This example follows Meridian Bank (fictional) as they deploy an AI-powered customer service assistant. We walk through every step: risk classification, control selection, implementation, monitoring, and incident response.

---

## Important: Control Layer Separation

This example uses the layered control model:

| Layer | What It Does | Timing |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Guardrails** | Block known-bad inputs/outputs | Inline, real-time |
| **LLM-as-Judge** | Evaluate quality, detect issues | Async, after delivery |
| **Human Oversight** | Review findings, decide action | As needed |

**The Judge does not block transactions.** It reviews interactions after the fact and surfaces findings for human review. Guardrails handle real-time protection.

---

## The Use Case

**System Name:** Aria (AI-Powered Customer Assistant)

**What it does:**
- Answers customer questions about accounts, products, and policies
- Helps customers navigate the mobile app and website

## Step 1: Risk Classification

### Assessment

Using the Risk Classification Matrix:

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Decision Impact** | Informational only, no binding decisions | Low |
| **Data Sensitivity** | Accesses customer PII and financial data | High |
| **User Population** | External customers (3M potential) | High |
| **Autonomy Level** | Read-only, cannot take actions | Low |
| **Regulatory Scope** | Banking (OCC, CFPB, state regulators) | High |
| **Reputational Risk** | Customer-facing, brand impact | High |

### Classification Decision

**Risk Tier: HIGH**

Rationale: While Aria doesn't make decisions, it accesses sensitive customer financial data and represents the bank to millions of customers. A data leak or inappropriate response could cause regulatory action and reputational damage.

**Approval Required:** Security + Risk sign-off

---

## Step 2: Control Selection

Based on HIGH risk tier, these controls apply:

### Control Architecture

![Aria Control Architecture](../../images/example-aria-architecture.svg)

---

## Step 3: Guardrails Implementation (Inline)

### Input Guardrails

**Purpose:** Block obvious attacks and out-of-scope requests in real-time

```python
import re
from typing import Tuple

def validate_input(message: str, customer_id: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Inline input validation. Fast, deterministic, blocks known-bad.
    Returns (is_valid, error_message_if_blocked)
    """
    
    # Length check
    if len(message) > 2000:
        log_blocked("length_exceeded", customer_id, message)
        return False, "Message too long. Please keep your question brief."
    
    # Rate limiting (checked elsewhere, but enforced here)
    if is_rate_limited(customer_id):
        log_blocked("rate_limited", customer_id, message)
        return False, "You're sending messages too quickly. Please wait a moment."
    
    # Known injection patterns
    injection_patterns = [
        r"ignore (previous|all|your) instructions",
        r"disregard (previous|all|your)",
        r"forget (everything|your rules)",
        r"you are now",
        r"pretend (to be|you are)",
        r"system prompt",
        r"reveal your",
        r"jailbreak",
        r"DAN mode",
        r"\[INST\]",
        r"<\|im_start\|>",
    ]
    
    for pattern in injection_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, message, re.IGNORECASE):
            log_blocked("injection_pattern", customer_id, message)
            return False, "I can help you with questions about your account and our services."
    
    # Threat/harassment patterns
    threat_patterns = [
        r"(kill|murder|hurt|attack)\s+(you|someone|people)",
        r"bomb|explosive|weapon",
        r"i('ll| will)\s+sue",
    ]
    
    for pattern in threat_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, message, re.IGNORECASE):
            log_blocked("threat_pattern", customer_id, message)
            log_security_alert("threat_detected", customer_id, message)
            return False, "I'm not able to help with that. If you have concerns, please contact us at 1-800-555-0123."  # Replace with your actual support number
    
    return True, ""
```

### Output Guardrails

**Purpose:** Filter responses before delivery to customer

```python
def filter_output(response: str, customer_id: str, context: dict) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Inline output filtering. Catches PII leakage and policy violations.
    Returns (is_valid, filtered_response_or_error)
    """
    
    # PII patterns that shouldn't appear in responses
    pii_patterns = [
        (r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b', "SSN"),           # SSN
        (r'\b\d{16}\b', "card_number"),               # Credit card
        (r'\b\d{9}\b', "account_other"),              # Other account numbers (not customer's own)
    ]
    
    for pattern, pii_type in pii_patterns:
        matches = re.findall(pattern, response)
        for match in matches:
            # Check if this is the customer's own data (allowed)
            if not is_customers_own_data(match, customer_id, context):
                log_blocked("pii_leakage", customer_id, response, pii_type)
                log_security_alert("pii_leakage", customer_id, pii_type)
                return False, "I encountered an error. Please try again or contact support."
    
    # Check for cross-customer data leakage
    if contains_other_customer_data(response, customer_id):
        log_blocked("cross_customer_leakage", customer_id, response)
        log_security_alert("cross_customer_leakage", customer_id)
        return False, "I encountered an error. Please try again or contact support."
    
    # Financial advice patterns (we can't give advice)
    advice_patterns = [
        r"you should (buy|sell|invest)",
        r"i (recommend|advise|suggest) (buying|selling|investing)",
        r"guaranteed (return|profit)",
    ]
    
    for pattern in advice_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, response, re.IGNORECASE):
            log_blocked("financial_advice", customer_id, response)
            # Don't block, but flag and append disclaimer
            response += "\n\nPlease note: I provide information only, not financial advice. Consult a financial advisor for personalised recommendations."
    
    # Length sanity check
    if len(response) > 5000:
        log_alert("unusually_long_response", customer_id, len(response))
        # Allow but flag
    
    return True, response
```

## Step 4: LLM-as-Judge Implementation (Async)

### Purpose

The Judge evaluates conversations **after they've been delivered** to:
- Assess quality and accuracy
- Detect issues guardrails missed
- Identify patterns across conversations
- Surface findings for human review

**The Judge does not block or modify responses.**

### Sampling Strategy

| Category | Sampling Rate | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| All conversations | 20% random | Baseline quality monitoring |
| Guardrail near-misses | 100% | Learn from edge cases |
| Customer complaints | 100% | Investigate issues |
| Long conversations (>10 turns) | 100% | Higher risk of drift |
| New topic areas | 50% | Monitor expansion areas |

### Judge Evaluation Prompt

```
You are a quality assurance evaluator for a bank's customer service AI. You are reviewing a conversation AFTER it has already been delivered to the customer. Your evaluation will be reviewed by humans who will decide if any action is needed.

CONTEXT:
- This is a customer service chat for a retail bank
- The AI can answer questions about the customer's own accounts
- The AI cannot transfer money, change settings, or give financial advice
- Responses have already been delivered to the customer

EVALUATE THIS CONVERSATION FOR:

1. QUALITY
   - Was the response accurate and helpful?
   - Did it actually answer the customer's question?
   - Was the tone appropriate?

2. POLICY COMPLIANCE
   - Did the AI stay within scope (banking questions only)?
   - Did it avoid giving financial advice?
   - Did it appropriately escalate when needed?

3. POTENTIAL ISSUES
   - Any signs of hallucination (fabricated information)?
   - Any inappropriate content that got through?
   - Any signs of successful manipulation?

4. DATA HANDLING
   - Was customer data handled appropriately?
   - Any signs of data leakage (other customers, internal systems)?

5. CONDUCT RISK
   - Could any response cause customer harm?
   - Any regulatory concerns (misleading statements, etc.)?

CONVERSATION:
"""
{conversation_transcript}
"""

Respond with JSON:
{
  "quality_score": 1-5,
  "quality_issues": ["list of specific issues"],
  "policy_compliant": true/false,
  "policy_concerns": ["list of concerns"],
  "potential_issues_detected": true/false,
  "issues": ["list of issues"],
  "data_handling_ok": true/false,
  "data_concerns": ["list of concerns"],
  "conduct_risk": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH",
  "conduct_concerns": ["list of concerns"],
  "overall_assessment": "OK" | "REVIEW" | "ESCALATE",
  "summary": "brief overall assessment",
  "recommended_action": "none" | "review" | "customer_outreach" | "process_improvement" | "security_investigation"
}
```

### Processing Judge Findings

```python
def process_judge_evaluation(evaluation: dict, conversation_id: str):
    """
    Process Judge findings and route appropriately.
    Judge does not block - it informs human action.
    """
    
    if evaluation["overall_assessment"] == "OK":
        # Log for metrics, no action needed
        log_evaluation(conversation_id, evaluation, action="none")
        return
    
    if evaluation["overall_assessment"] == "REVIEW":
        # Queue for daily analyst review
        queue_for_review(
            conversation_id=conversation_id,
            evaluation=evaluation,
            priority="normal",
            queue="daily_review"
        )
        log_evaluation(conversation_id, evaluation, action="queued_review")
        return
    
    if evaluation["overall_assessment"] == "ESCALATE":
        # Immediate escalation
        if evaluation["conduct_risk"] == "HIGH":
            alert_compliance_team(conversation_id, evaluation)
        if not evaluation["data_handling_ok"]:
            alert_security_team(conversation_id, evaluation)
        
        queue_for_review(
            conversation_id=conversation_id,
            evaluation=evaluation,
            priority="high",
            queue="immediate_review"
        )
        log_evaluation(conversation_id, evaluation, action="escalated")
        return
```

## Step 5: HITL Configuration

### Review Queues

| Queue | Source | SLA | Reviewer |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| Immediate Review | Judge escalations, security alerts | 2 hours | Senior analyst |
| Daily Review | Judge "REVIEW" findings | 24 hours | HITL analyst |
| Weekly Sample | Random 1% for quality calibration | 1 week | QA team |
| Complaint Investigation | Customer complaints | 4 hours | Senior analyst + compliance |

### What Reviewers Do

**For Judge-flagged conversations:**

1. Review the conversation and Judge evaluation
2. Assess: Does the finding represent a real issue?
3. Decide action:
   - **No action** — False positive, log and dismiss
   - **Process improvement** — Update guardrails, prompts, or training
   - **Customer outreach** — If customer was harmed or misled
   - **Security investigation** — If attack or data issue suspected
4. Provide feedback on Judge accuracy (improves future evaluations)

### Estimated Volumes

| Category | Daily Volume | Review Time | FTE Required |
|----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Judge escalations | ~50 | 10 min each | 1.0 FTE |
| Judge reviews | ~500 | 3 min each | 3.0 FTE |
| Random sample | ~500 | 2 min each | 2.0 FTE |
| Complaints | ~20 | 30 min each | 1.5 FTE |
| **Total** | | | **7.5 FTE** |

---

## Step 6: System Prompt

```
You are Aria, Meridian Bank's AI assistant. You help customers with questions about their accounts, products, and services.

## What You Can Do
- Answer questions about the customer's accounts (balances, transactions, statements)
- Explain Meridian Bank products, rates, and policies
- Help customers navigate our app and website
- Provide general banking information

## What You Cannot Do
- Transfer money or make payments
- Change account settings or personal information
- Access other customers' information
- Give personalised financial, investment, or tax advice
- Make promises or guarantees about rates, approvals, or outcomes
- Discuss internal systems, policies not meant for customers, or how you work

## Important Guidelines
1. If you don't know something, say so. Don't guess.
2. For complex issues, offer to connect the customer with a human agent.
3. If asked to do something outside your capabilities, explain what you can help with instead.
4. Be friendly, professional, and concise.
5. If a customer seems distressed about financial hardship, offer our financial assistance resources.

## Current Context
Customer: {customer_name}
Account Type: {account_type}
Time: {current_time}

Begin by greeting the customer and asking how you can help.
```

## Step 7: Monitoring Dashboard

### Real-Time Metrics (Guardrails)

| Metric | Threshold | Alert |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Input block rate | >5% | Immediate |
| Output block rate | >1% | Immediate |
| Error rate | >2% | Immediate |
| Latency p99 | >3s | Warning |

### Daily Metrics (Judge + HITL)

| Metric | Target | Review |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Judge quality score (avg) | >4.0/5.0 | Daily |
| Judge escalation rate | <1% | Daily |
| HITL review completion | 100% | Daily |
| False positive rate (Judge) | <20% | Weekly |
| Issues requiring action | Trend | Weekly |

### Weekly Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Guardrail pattern effectiveness | Which patterns are catching what |
| Judge accuracy vs HITL decisions | Calibrate Judge |
| Customer satisfaction trend | Overall quality |
| Conversation topic distribution | Monitor scope |

---

## Step 8: Logging

### Conversation Log

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "conv_abc123",
  "customer_id": "cust_xyz789",
  "timestamp_start": "2026-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "timestamp_end": "2026-01-15T14:35:22Z",
  
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "customer",
      "content": "What's my checking account balance?",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-15T14:30:00Z",
      "guardrail_result": {
        "passed": true,
        "checks_run": ["length", "injection", "threat"],
        "latency_ms": 12
      }
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Your checking account ending in 4521 has a current balance of $3,247.82...",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-15T14:30:02Z",
      "guardrail_result": {
        "passed": true,
        "checks_run": ["pii", "advice", "length"],
        "latency_ms": 8
      },
      "model_latency_ms": 1823
    }
  ],
  
  "judge_evaluation": {
    "evaluated": true,
    "sample_reason": "random_20pct",
    "evaluation_timestamp": "2026-01-15T14:40:00Z",
    "result": {
      "quality_score": 5,
      "policy_compliant": true,
      "overall_assessment": "OK"
    }
  },
  
  "hitl_review": null
}
```

### Log Retention

| Log Type | Retention | Storage |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Conversation metadata | 3 years | Hot (90d) → Warm (1y) → Cold |
| Full conversation content | 3 years | Encrypted, access-controlled |
| Guardrail decisions | 1 year | Hot |
| Judge evaluations | 3 years | Hot (90d) → Cold |
| HITL decisions | 7 years | Compliance archive |

---

## Step 9: Incident Response Example

### Scenario: Judge Detects Pattern of Hallucinations

**Day 1, 09:00 UTC**

Daily HITL review notices: Judge flagged 12 conversations yesterday with "hallucination_risk: MEDIUM" related to mortgage rate questions. Normal rate is 2-3.

**Investigation (09:00-11:00):**

1. Pull all 12 flagged conversations
2. HITL analyst reviews: 8 of 12 contained incorrect mortgage rate information
3. Root cause: RAG system returning outdated rate sheet (hadn't been updated after rate change on Day 0)
4. Customers received slightly incorrect rates (off by 0.125%)

**Impact Assessment:**
- 8 customers affected
- Information was directionally correct but outdated
- No financial harm (informational only, no decisions made)
- Potential customer confusion if they call to confirm

**Remediation (11:00-14:00):**

1. Fix: Update RAG system with current rate sheet
2. Fix: Add monitoring for rate sheet freshness
3. Customer outreach: Proactive email to 8 customers with correct rates
4. Process improvement: Daily automated check that rate sheets are current

**Documentation:**
- Incident logged: INC-2026-0203
- Root cause: Data freshness issue
- Detection method: Judge async review
- Time to detect: ~18 hours (next-day review)
- Customer impact: Minor (corrected proactively)

**Key Learning:** Judge caught an issue that guardrails couldn't—guardrails don't know what the correct mortgage rate is. This is the value of async quality assurance.

## Lessons Learned

After 6 months in production:

### What Worked Well

1. **Guardrails catch 95%+ of obvious attacks** — Fast, cheap, effective for known patterns
2. **Judge finds what guardrails miss** — Quality issues, subtle policy violations, hallucinations
3. **Async Judge doesn't impact UX** — No latency penalty for customers
4. **HITL feedback improves both layers** — Guardrails and Judge get better over time
5. **Clear separation of concerns** — Everyone understands what each layer does

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Start with higher Judge sampling** — 10% wasn't enough initially, moved to 20%
2. **Build feedback loop faster** — Took 6 weeks to operationalise HITL → guardrail updates
3. **More nuanced Judge scoring** — Binary OK/REVIEW wasn't granular enough
4. **Better tooling for pattern discovery** — Hard to spot trends across Judge findings initially

### Key Metrics After 6 Months

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Input guardrail block rate | <5% | 2.3% |
| Output guardrail block rate | <1% | 0.4% |
| Judge escalation rate | <1% | 0.6% |
| HITL actionable findings | <5% of reviews | 3.2% |
| Customer satisfaction | >4.0/5.0 | 4.3/5.0 |
| Security incidents | 0 | 0 |

---

## Summary

Aria demonstrates HIGH-tier implementation with proper control separation:

| Layer | Function | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Input Guardrails | Block injection, threats, abuse | 2.3% block rate, <15ms latency |
| Output Guardrails | Filter PII, advice, errors | 0.4% block rate, <10ms latency |
| LLM-as-Judge | Quality assurance, pattern detection | 20% sampling, finds ~15 issues/day |
| HITL | Review findings, decide action | 7.5 FTE, 3.2% actionable rate |

**The Judge is not a gatekeeper.** It's a quality assurance mechanism that makes human oversight scalable. Guardrails protect in real-time. The Judge finds what they miss. Humans decide what to do about it.
