# Control Selection Guide

How to select the right controls for your AI system based on risk tier and use case characteristics.

---

## Overview

Not every AI system needs every control. This guide helps you select appropriate controls based on:

1. **Risk tier** — CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
2. **Use case type** — Customer-facing, internal, agentic, batch
3. **Data sensitivity** — PII, financial, regulated, public
4. **Decision impact** — Consequential, advisory, informational

## Step 1: Determine Risk Tier

### Risk Tier Decision Tree

![Risk Tier Decision Tree](../../images/control-selection-decision-tree.svg)

### Risk Tier Examples

| System | Tier | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Credit decision support | CRITICAL | Directly affects lending decisions |
| Fraud detection AI | CRITICAL | False negatives allow fraud; false positives block customers |
| Trading signal generator | CRITICAL | Financial impact, regulatory scrutiny |
| Customer service chatbot | HIGH | Customer-facing, handles account queries |
| Document extraction (PII) | HIGH | Processes sensitive data at scale |
| Internal HR assistant | HIGH | Employment-related, PII |
| Meeting summariser | MEDIUM | Internal, limited sensitivity |
| Code assistant (internal) | MEDIUM | Internal productivity, no customer data |
| Marketing copy generator | MEDIUM | External-facing content, but reviewed |
| Sandbox experiments | LOW | No production data, no customer impact |
| Internal POC | LOW | Limited scope, controlled access |

## Step 2: Identify Use Case Characteristics

### Use Case Type Matrix

| Characteristic | Control Implications |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Customer-facing** | Output guardrails critical; Judge sampling higher; HITL escalation paths |
| **Internal-only** | Can tolerate more latency; focus on data protection |
| **Agentic** | Full AG.1-AG.4 controls; circuit breakers mandatory |
| **Batch processing** | Can use heavier Judge evaluation; lower latency requirements |
| **Real-time** | Guardrail latency budget critical; async Judge only |
| **Decision support** | HITL mandatory for final decision; AI advisory only |
| **Fully automated** | Higher scrutiny; regulatory constraints (GDPR Art 22) |

### Data Sensitivity Matrix

| Data Type | Additional Controls |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **PII** | AI.5.3 Privacy, output PII filtering, data minimisation |
| **Financial** | AI.11 enhanced logging, AI.9 HITL for decisions |
| **Health** | HIPAA/regulatory compliance, AI.5.1 classification |
| **Credit** | SR 11-7 / SS1/23 model risk, AI.6.2 validation |
| **Authentication** | Never in AI context; AI.7.1 input filtering |
| **Regulated** | AI.13 vendor due diligence, AI.3.2 documentation |

## Step 4: Apply Use Case Modifiers

### Agentic AI Modifier

If your system is **agentic** (takes actions, not just generates content), add:

| Control | All Agentic Systems |
|---------|---------------------|
| AG.1.1 Plan disclosure | ✅ Required |
| AG.1.2 Plan guardrails | ✅ Required |
| AG.1.3 Plan approval | Based on tier |
| AG.2.1 Action guardrails | ✅ Required |
| AG.2.2 Circuit breakers | ✅ Required |
| AG.2.3 Scope enforcement | ✅ Required |
| AG.2.4 Tool controls | ✅ Required |
| AG.2.5 Tool protocol security | ✅ Required |
| AG.3.1 Trajectory logging | ✅ Required |
| AG.3.2 Trajectory evaluation | Based on tier |
| AG.3.3 Agentic HITL | Based on tier |
| AG.4.1 Agent inventory | ✅ Required |
| AG.4.2 Orchestration controls | If multi-agent |
| AG.4.3 Trace correlation | ✅ Required |

### Customer-Facing Modifier

If your system is **customer-facing**, add:

| Enhancement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Increase Judge sampling by 1 tier | Higher reputational risk |
| Output guardrails mandatory | Customer protection |
| Escalation SLAs tightened | Customer impact |
| HITL queue prioritisation | Customer experience |
| Incident notification to customers | Regulatory requirement |

### Regulated Data Modifier

If your system handles **regulated data** (credit, health, financial):

| Enhancement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Full AI.6.2 validation (SR 11-7 style) | Regulatory requirement |
| AI.3.4 Explainability at CRITICAL level | Right to explanation |
| AI.9.1 HITL mandatory for decisions | GDPR Art 22, fair lending |
| AI.11.1 Logging at CRITICAL level | Audit trail |
| AI.12.4 Regulatory notification | Reporting requirements |

### Batch Processing Modifier

If your system operates in **batch mode** (not real-time):

| Adjustment | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Guardrail latency budget relaxed | No real-time requirement |
| Judge can evaluate 100% even at lower tiers | Processing time available |
| HITL can review before results released | Batch allows pre-release review |
| Rollback easier | Can reprocess batch |

---

## Step 5: Document Control Selection

For each AI system, document:

| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| **System name** | Unique identifier |
| **Risk tier** | CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| **Tier rationale** | Why this tier was selected |
| **Use case type** | Customer-facing, internal, agentic, batch |
| **Data sensitivity** | PII, financial, regulated, public |
| **Decision impact** | Consequential, advisory, informational |
| **Modifiers applied** | Which modifiers and why |
| **Controls selected** | Full list with evidence requirements |
| **Controls deferred** | Any controls not implemented and rationale |
| **Review schedule** | When to reassess tier and controls |

## Review and Reassessment

### Triggers for Reassessment

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Use case scope expands | Reassess tier |
| New data types added | Reassess data sensitivity |
| Customer-facing deployment | Likely tier increase |
| Model upgrade | Capability assessment |
| Regulatory change | Control alignment review |
| Incident occurs | Post-incident control review |
| Annual review | Full reassessment |

### Review Schedule

| Tier | Full Reassessment | Control Verification |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| CRITICAL | Quarterly | Monthly |
| HIGH | Biannually | Quarterly |
| MEDIUM | Annually | Biannually |
| LOW | Annually | Annually |
