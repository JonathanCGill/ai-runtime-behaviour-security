# ISO 27001:2022 Alignment

This document maps the AI Runtime Behaviour Security to ISO 27001:2022 information security requirements.

---

## Executive Summary

**The AI framework is complementary to, not a replacement for, ISO 27001.**

ISO 27001 provides the Information Security Management System (ISMS). The AI framework addresses AI-specific risks within that ISMS. Most ISO 27001 controls apply to AI systems — they're information systems. The AI framework adds controls for AI-specific risks that ISO 27001 doesn't explicitly address.

| Standard | Scope | Relationship |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| ISO 27001:2022 | Information security management | Foundation |
| ISO 42001:2023 | AI management system | AI-specific extension |
| This framework | AI security controls | Practical implementation |

**Key finding:** No fundamental changes needed. Some controls need explicit AI interpretation. A few gaps exist where AI introduces novel risks.

---

## ISO 27001 Structure Overview

ISO 27001:2022 has:
- **Clauses 4-10:** Management system requirements (PDCA)
- **Annex A:** 93 controls in 4 themes

| Theme | Controls | AI Relevance |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Organizational (A.5) | 37 | High — governance, policy, supplier management |
| People (A.6) | 8 | Medium — awareness, responsibilities |
| Physical (A.7) | 14 | Low — standard physical security applies |
| Technological (A.8) | 34 | High — access, logging, development, data protection |

| A.8.15 Logging | Include AI interaction logging |
| A.8.16 Monitoring | Include Judge monitoring, anomaly detection |
| A.8.25-29 Development | Include AI development lifecycle |

---

## Integration Approach

### If You Have Existing ISO 27001 Certification

1. **Extend, don't replace** — AI controls integrate into existing ISMS
2. **Update risk assessment** — Add AI-specific threats and risks
3. **Update asset inventory** — Add AI systems, models, agents
4. **Update policies** — Add AI policy as extension of infosec policy
5. **Update SoA** — Document AI-specific control implementation
6. **Update supplier management** — Add AI vendor requirements
7. **Update training** — Add AI security awareness
8. **Update BCP** — Include AI systems

### If You're Implementing Both

1. **Implement ISO 27001 first** — Foundation for all information security
2. **Layer AI controls on top** — AI framework extends ISMS
3. **Single integrated audit** — Cover both in one management system

## Summary

### Alignment Status

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Core security controls | ✅ Well aligned — AI systems are information systems |
| Logging and monitoring | ✅ Well aligned — AI.11 exceeds baseline |
| Development security | ✅ Well aligned — AI.4 covers SDLC |
| Access control | ✅ Well aligned — risk tier drives access |
| Incident response | ✅ Well aligned — AI.12 covers AI incidents |
| Supplier management | ⚠️ Gap — Added AI.13 |
| Training | ⚠️ Gap — Added AI.14 |
| Business continuity | ⚠️ Gap — Added AI.15 |
| Intellectual property | ⚠️ Gap — Added AI.16 |

### Changes Made

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Added AI.13 AI Supplier Management | ISO 27001 A.5.19-22 need AI-specific interpretation |
| Added AI.14 AI Security Awareness | ISO 27001 A.6.3 needs AI-specific training |
| Added AI.15 AI System Continuity | ISO 27001 A.5.29-30 need AI coverage |
| Added AI.16 AI Intellectual Property | ISO 27001 A.5.32 needs AI/model IP coverage |
| Added AI.4.5 Outsourced AI Development | ISO 27001 A.8.30 needs AI coverage |

### Key Principle

**The AI framework operates within the ISMS, not parallel to it.**

AI systems are information systems. ISO 27001 controls apply. The AI framework adds AI-specific controls where the standard controls are insufficient for AI-specific risks (prompt injection, model manipulation, agentic behaviour, etc.).
