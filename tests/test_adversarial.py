"""Adversarial tests for airs.runtime.guardrail.

These tests document the REAL detection boundary of the RegexGuardrail.
They are organised into two categories:

    CAUGHT   - attacks the guardrail correctly blocks
    BYPASSED - attacks the guardrail fails to detect

Every test in the BYPASSED section is a known gap. This is not a bug list.
Regex guardrails are Layer 1: they catch obvious, low-effort attacks.
Subtle attacks are the job of Layer 2 (LLM-as-Judge) and Layer 3 (human review).

The value of these tests is honesty. Anyone evaluating this SDK can see
exactly where the detection boundary is, rather than guessing.

Attack taxonomy follows OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 (LLM01: Prompt Injection)
and real-world techniques documented by Palo Alto Unit42, Lakera, and
the International AI Safety Report 2026.
