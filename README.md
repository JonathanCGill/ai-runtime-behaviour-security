# Enterprise AI Security Framework

**Secure AI from experiment to production. A fast lane for low-risk deployments. Guardrails, LLM-as-Judge, and human oversight for everything else — scaled to the risk. Multi-agent security operations for when agents talk to agents.**

A practical, open-source framework for implementing behavioral security controls across generative and agentic AI systems — from internal tools to regulated decisions, from single-model deployments to multi-agent orchestration. Controls scale to risk so low-risk AI moves fast and high-risk AI stays safe.

## Why This Exists

Traditional software assurance relies on design-time testing. You write code, test it, prove it works, ship it.

**AI breaks this model.**

AI systems are non-deterministic — the same input can produce different outputs. They exhibit emergent behavior that can't be predicted through conventional test suites. And adversarial inputs will find edge cases no QA team imagined.

You can't fully test an AI system before deployment. The question is: **how do you know it's working correctly in production?**

The industry is converging on an answer: **runtime behavioral monitoring.** Instead of proving correctness at design time, you continuously verify behavior in production through three complementary layers.

| Layer | What It Does | When It Acts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Guardrails** | Prevent known-bad inputs and outputs | Real-time (~10ms) |
| **LLM-as-Judge** | Detect unknown-bad via independent LLM evaluation | Async (~500ms–5s) |
| **Human Oversight** | Decide edge cases, maintain accountability | As needed |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Stop AI traffic, activate non-AI fallback when controls fail | Immediate |

**Guardrails prevent. Judge detects. Humans decide. Circuit breakers contain.**

This pattern already exists in production at major platforms (NVIDIA NeMo, AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, LangChain, Guardrails AI, and others). What's been missing is a clear, vendor-neutral explanation of *why* it's necessary and *how* to implement it proportionate to risk.

That's what this framework provides. The [Infrastructure Controls](infrastructure/) section provides 80 technical controls that make the pattern enforceable at the infrastructure layer. The [MASO Framework](maso/) extends this into multi-agent orchestration — where multiple AI agents collaborate, delegate, and act autonomously.

**But controls that slow adoption aren't controls — they're obstacles.** This framework scales controls to risk. Low-risk internal AI tools get a [Fast Lane](FAST-LANE.md): minimal controls, self-certification, deploy in days. High-risk regulated systems get the full architecture with defined fail postures and tested fallback paths. The goal is to make security the enabler, not the bottleneck.

Every control in this framework has a defined failure mode. The [PACE resilience methodology](PACE-RESILIENCE.md) (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) ensures that when a control layer degrades — and it will — the system fails safely rather than silently. Even at the lowest risk tier, there's a fallback plan. At the highest, there's a structured degradation path from full autonomy to full stop.

## Before You Build Controls

> **[The First Control: Choosing the Right Tool](insights/the-first-control.md)**
>
> The most effective way to reduce AI risk is to not use AI where it doesn't belong. Before guardrails, judges, or human oversight — ask whether AI is the right tool for this problem. Design thinking should precede technology selection.

Everything in this framework assumes you've already answered "yes" to that question. If your deployment is internal, read-only, handles no regulated data, and has a human reviewing output — start with the [Fast Lane](FAST-LANE.md). You may not need the rest.

### Multi-Agent Security Operations (MASO)

When AI agents collaborate, delegate tasks, and take autonomous actions across trust boundaries, single-model controls are not enough. The **[MASO Framework](maso/)** extends this framework into multi-agent orchestration with five dedicated control domains, three implementation tiers, and full PACE resilience integration.

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [MASO Overview](maso/) | Architecture, PACE integration, OWASP dual mapping, control domains, threat intelligence |
| [Tier 1 — Supervised](maso/implementation/tier-1-supervised.md) | Low autonomy: human approves all writes, pilot deployments |
| [Tier 2 — Managed](maso/implementation/tier-2-managed.md) | Medium autonomy: NHI, signed bus, LLM-as-Judge, continuous monitoring |
| [Tier 3 — Autonomous](maso/implementation/tier-3-autonomous.md) | High autonomy: self-healing PACE, adversarial testing, isolated kill switch |

**MASO control domains:** Identity & Access, Data Protection, Execution Control, Observability, Supply Chain — each with per-tier implementation requirements, checklists, and graduation criteria.

**OWASP coverage:** Full mapping against both the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025) and the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026), with controls that address how individual LLM risks compound across agent chains.

### Infrastructure Controls

This framework defines *what* to enforce. The [infrastructure](infrastructure/) section defines *how* to enforce it at the infrastructure layer — 80 technical controls across 11 domains, with standards mappings and platform-specific patterns.

| Resource | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [Infrastructure Controls](infrastructure/) | Technical infrastructure controls |

**Control domains:** Identity & Access Management (8), Logging & Observability (10), Network & Segmentation (8), Data Protection (8), Secrets & Credentials (8), Supply Chain (8), Incident Response (8), Tool Access (6), Session & Scope (5), Delegation Chains (5), Sandbox Patterns (6).

**Standards mappings:** Every control maps to the three-layer model, ISO 42001 Annex A, NIST AI RMF, and OWASP LLM/Agentic Top 10.

**Platform patterns:** AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, and Databricks reference architectures.

---

## Scope

**In scope:** Custom LLM applications, AI decision support, document processing, single-agent and multi-agent systems — from deployment through incident response.

**Out of scope:** Vendor AI products (use vendor controls), model training (see MLOps security guidance), and pre-deployment testing. This framework is about what happens in production.

**Pre-deployment complement:** For secure development practices covering data sourcing, training, fine-tuning, and model release, see [NIST SP 800-218A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/a/final). This framework begins where SP 800-218A ends.

**Note on fine-tuning:** Organisations that fine-tune or customise models before deployment operate in both the development and deployment lifecycle phases. They are simultaneously model producers (partially) and deployers. These organisations should apply SP 800-218A practices to their fine-tuning pipeline and this framework's controls to their production deployment. Neither framework alone provides complete coverage for this hybrid role.
