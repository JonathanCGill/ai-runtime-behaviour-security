# EU AI Act Crosswalk

This document maps the Enterprise AI Security Framework controls to EU AI Act requirements.

---

## Overview

The EU AI Act establishes requirements for AI systems based on risk classification. This crosswalk focuses on **high-risk AI systems** (Annex III), which face the most stringent requirements.

**Key principle:** The framework's control model—guardrails prevent, Judge detects, humans decide—aligns well with the EU AI Act's emphasis on human oversight and risk management.

---

## EU AI Act Risk Categories

| Category | Description | Framework Alignment |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Unacceptable Risk | Prohibited AI practices | Out of scope (don't build these) |
| High Risk | Annex III systems (credit, employment, etc.) | CRITICAL tier |
| Limited Risk | Transparency obligations | HIGH/MEDIUM tier |
| Minimal Risk | No specific requirements | LOW tier |

---

## High-Risk AI System Requirements

### Article 9: Risk Management System

4. **Ongoing management:** Async Judge monitoring, HITL feedback loops

---

### Article 10: Data and Data Governance

**Requirement:** High-risk AI systems using training data shall be developed on the basis of training, validation, and testing datasets that meet quality criteria.

| EU AI Act Requirement | Framework Control | Implementation |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Relevant, representative, free of errors | AI.5.2 Data Quality | Training data validation |
| Appropriate statistical properties | AI.5.2 Data Quality | Data quality metrics |
| Account for specific settings | AI.5.2 Data Quality | Context-appropriate data |
| Examine for biases | AI.6.2 Model Validation | Bias testing |

**How the framework satisfies this:**

1. **Data governance:** AI.5 Data Governance control family
2. **Quality assurance:** Judge can evaluate for quality issues
3. **Bias detection:** Bias monitoring as part of Judge evaluation (CRITICAL tier)

---

### Article 11: Technical Documentation

| EU AI Act Requirement | Framework Control | Implementation |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| General description | AI.3.2 System Documentation | System documentation package |
| Detailed description of elements | AI.3.2 System Documentation | Architecture, data flows |
| Monitoring, functioning, control | AI.11 Logging & Monitoring | Monitoring documentation |
| Risk management system description | AI.2 Risk Management | Risk assessment records |
| Description of changes | AI.3.2 System Documentation | Change documentation |

**How the framework satisfies this:**

1. **Documentation requirements scale by tier:** CRITICAL requires full SR 11-7-style documentation
2. **Inventory and documentation:** AI.3 control family
3. **Change management:** Part of AI.4 Development Security

---

### Article 12: Record-Keeping

**Requirement:** High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for automatic recording of events (logs).

| EU AI Act Requirement | Framework Control | Implementation |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Recording period of operation | AI.11.1 Comprehensive Logging | Full interaction logging |
| Reference database against which checked | AI.11.1 Comprehensive Logging | Context and source logging |
| Traceability of functioning | AI.11.1 Comprehensive Logging | Audit trail |

**How the framework satisfies this:**

1. **Comprehensive logging:** CRITICAL tier requires full content logging with 7-year retention
2. **Traceability:** Correlation IDs, timestamps, full context
3. **Judge evaluation logs:** Additional assurance documentation

---

### Article 13: Transparency and Provision of Information to Deployers

**Requirement:** High-risk AI systems shall be designed to ensure their operation is sufficiently transparent.

| EU AI Act Requirement | Framework Control | Implementation |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Understand output and use appropriately | AI.9.1 Human-in-the-Loop | HITL ensures understanding |
| Characteristics, capabilities, limitations | AI.3.2 System Documentation | Documentation package |
| Intended purpose | AI.3.1 AI System Inventory | Inventory records |
| Level of accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity | AI.6.2 Model Validation | Validation reports |

**How the framework satisfies this:**

1. **Transparency to users:** System prompts, UI design, documentation
2. **Transparency to oversight:** Judge reasoning, HITL context

---

### Article 14: Human Oversight

**Requirement:** High-risk AI systems shall be designed to allow for effective human oversight during use.

| EU AI Act Requirement | Framework Control | Implementation |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Properly understand capabilities and limitations | AI.9.1 HITL | Training, documentation |
| Remain aware of automation bias | AI.9.1 HITL | Reviewer independence |
| Correctly interpret output | AI.9.1 HITL | Context in review interface |
| Decide not to use in any situation | AI.9.3 Human Override | Override capability |
| Intervene or interrupt | AI.9.3 Human Override | Stop capability |

**How the framework satisfies this:**

This is where the framework's control model is specifically designed to comply:

1. **Guardrails prevent** — Real-time protection, humans can override/disable
2. **Judge detects** — Surfaces issues for human review, does NOT make decisions
3. **Humans decide** — HITL reviews findings, makes all consequential decisions

**Critical alignment:**
- The Judge is explicitly NOT a decision-maker
- Humans remain accountable for all outcomes
- Override capability is mandatory
- CRITICAL tier requires human decision on all consequential actions

**This avoids GDPR Article 22 concerns** about solely automated decision-making by ensuring meaningful human involvement.

---

### Article 15: Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity

**Requirement:** High-risk AI systems shall be designed to achieve appropriate levels of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.

### Article 9 Evidence

| Evidence | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Risk assessment methodology | Documented methodology |
| Risk classification for system | Classification record |
| Control selection rationale | Mapping to risk tier |
| Test results | Validation reports, golden set results |
| Ongoing monitoring reports | Judge summaries, drift reports |

### Article 14 Evidence

## GDPR Article 22 Alignment

**GDPR Article 22** gives data subjects the right not to be subject to solely automated decisions with legal or significant effects.

**How the framework satisfies this:**

| GDPR Requirement | Framework Implementation |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Not solely automated | HITL for all CRITICAL decisions |
| Meaningful human involvement | Humans decide, not rubber-stamp |
| Right to human intervention | Override capability |
| Right to explanation | Judge reasoning + human decision trail |

**The Judge's role is critical here:**
- Judge does NOT make decisions
- Judge surfaces findings for humans
- Humans make the decision
- Therefore, decision is not "solely automated"
